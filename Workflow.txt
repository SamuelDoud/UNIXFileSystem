Sam: Devise a way so a function can know the length of an array... probably
this means passing the length as an index or saving the length of, lets say
the data bitmap, as a defined constant.

I think I have figured this out by using a struct to store both the bitmap
and bytemaps along with their lengths.

Sam: I need work done on the APIs so that I know what parts of the filesystem
need immediate attn. I would like to have this project done by Friday so that
we can have adequate time to debug it!
